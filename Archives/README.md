#### To-Do : theme styling : 
As usual, remember to set aside extra time for aesthetic/functional styling for the document.
**Guidelines : **
- build from as few colors as possible
- minimum 2 colors : 1 for font (color), 1 for fill (background-color)
- maximum 8 colors (max 4 for *color* , 4 for *background-color* )
- more colors should be created using opacity (transparency overlays) or gradients
- this allows for greater user customization with less hardware overhead
